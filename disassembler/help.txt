Disassembler converts the machine code back to source code.

The right way to call it:
    ./Disassembler program.code [source.asm]
    
    (1)'program.code' stands for the output.
    (2)'source.asm' stands for the file with code and may not be given. The result is written to 'source.asm' in this case.

Other possible keys:
    --help        get help
    --version     get version
