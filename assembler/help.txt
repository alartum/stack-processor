Assembler converts the source code into machine code.
The right way to call it:
    Assembler source.asm [program.code]
    
    (1)'source.asm' stands for the file with code;
    (2)'program.code' stands for the output and may not be given.
    The result is written to 'program.code' in this case.
    
Other possible keys:
    --help to get help
    --version to get version
